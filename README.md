# About this Project

## Description

Our app is a simple way for someone to find out what sort of mixed drinks they can create based on the contents of their fridge. They can select the ingredients via checkboxes; such as the type of alcohol and a key extra ingredient; then they will be presented with a list of possible drinks that they can make. When the user decides on what drink to create, they can click the create button, and it will open a modal with instructions of how to make the drink and also Youtube video showing how to make the drink.

This app should ease the stress of any user who has a hard time coming up with fun alcoholic drinks for any party.
